# Running labelmerge on your data

This section goes over the command line options you will find most useful when
running labelmerge on your dataset, along with describing some issues you may face.

_Note: Please first refer to the simple example in the 
[Installation](https://labelmerge.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) 
section, which goes over running labelmerge on a test dataset and the essential 
required options._

## Including / excluding subjects to process
By default, labelmerge will run on **all** subjects in the dataset. If you wish to 
run on only a subset of subjects, you can use the `--participant-label` flag:

```
--participant-label 001
```

which would only run on `sub-001`. You can add additional subjects by passing
a space-separated list to this option:

```
--participant-label 001 002
```

which would run for `sub-001` and `sub-002`.

Similarly, subjects can be excluded from processing using the 
`--exclude-participant-label` flag.

## BIDS Parsing limitations

Labelmerge uses Snakebids, which makes use of pybids to parse a [BIDS-compliant
dataset](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). However, because of the way Snakebids
and Snakemake operate, one limitation is that the input files in your BIDS 
dataset needs to be consistent in terms of what optional BIDS entities exist in
them. We can use the acqusition (`acq`) entity as an example. Labelmerge should have
no problem parsing the following dataset:

```
PATH_TO_BIDS_DIR/
└── dataset_description.json
└── sub-001/
    └── anat/
        └── sub-001_acq-mprage_desc-1_T1w.nii.gz
└── sub-002/
    └── anat/
        ├── sub-002_acq-spgr__desc-2_T1w.nii.gz
...
```

as the path (with wildcards) will be interpreted as 
`sub-{subject}_acq-{acq}_desc-{desc}_T1w.nii.gz`.

However, the following dataset will raise an error:

```
PATH_TO_BIDS_DIR/
└── dataset_description.json
└── sub-001/
    └── anat/
        ├── sub-001_acq-mprage_desc_1_T1w.nii.gz
└── sub-002/
    └── anat/
        ├── sub-002_desc-2_T1w.nii.gz
...
```

because two distinct paths (with wildcards) would be found for T1w images:
`sub-{subject}_acq-{acq}_desc-{desc}_T1w.nii.gz` and `sub-{subject}_desc-{desc}_T1w.nii.gz`.

Similarly, you could not have some subjects with the `ses` identifier, and some
subjects without it. There will soon be added functionality in Snakebids to 
filter out extra files, but for now, if your dataset has these issues, you will
need to rename or remove extraneous files.
